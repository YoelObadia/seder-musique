Our goal is simple: to create a memorable event with impeccable performance and a seamless experience for the organizer. Beyond booking, Seder Music also supports brands and projects in artistic influencer marketing: strategic networking, campaign creation, and visibility through artists perfectly suited to the brand image and target audience. And because a great agency doesn't just book stars, we've also developed an in-house label: R&D Records. Through it, we sign, manage, and develop emerging artists and up-and-coming talents, whom we train, structure, and propel—even integrating some of them into major venues and Seder Music's opportunities. In short: Seder Music orchestrates the high level (stars & events), and R&D Records builds the future (new talent & artistic development)—all within the same ecosystem, with a single requirement: quality.",
